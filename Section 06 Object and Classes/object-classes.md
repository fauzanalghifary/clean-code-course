## Object vs Data Structure

- Object
  - private internals/properties, public API (methods)
  - contain your business logic (in OOP)
  - abstractions over concretions
- Data Structure/Data Containers
  - public internals/properties, almost no API (methods)
  - store and transport data
  - concretions only

## Polymorphism

- The ability of an object to take on many forms

## Classes should be small

- prefer many small classes over a few large classes
- Classes should have a single responsibility (SRP)

## Cohesion

- How much your class methods using the class properties
  - maximum cohesion (a highly cohesive object)
  - no cohesion (data container with utility methods)
- Goals => highly cohesive classes
