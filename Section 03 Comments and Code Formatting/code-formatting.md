## Formatting

- rules differ between language

## Vertical Formatting

- should be readable like an essay (top to bottom without too many jumps)
  - code splitting files
  - different concepts should be seperated by spacing
  - similar concepts shouldn't be seperated by spacing
  - related concepts should be close to each other

## Horizontal Formatting

- use indentation
- break long statement into multiple line
- use clear but not unreadably long names
